README FOR PART III
===================

I have provided two implementations of this functionality. The first is found
in expr.h and uses templates to calculate the indices at compile time. The
other is in run_time_expr.h and uses a reference to a variable that is
incremented on each access of x, to calculate the indices at runtime.
